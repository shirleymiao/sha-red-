                <h1>About</h1>
                <h2>FILTE(RED) is a web app built to raise awareness and spread support for (RED) and its role in the movement to eliminate AIDS in Africa.</h2><br>
                <p class="lead">FILTE(RED) was born at Square's 3rd College Code Camp and built in 12 hours by roommates Bethany Davis and Shirley Miao.  We were inspired by the scope and power of other social media movements in influencing support for non-profits such as the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and Chevy's Purple-Your-Profile for World Cancer Day.</p><br>
                <p class="lead">FILTE(RED) allows you to upload a photo of your choice and add the (RED) signature branding to your face.  You can then save the picture on your computer or post it directly to your Twitter page.</p><br>
                <p class="lead">Looking to the future, FILTE(RED) can expand and improve in many ways.  Additional filters and stickers can be used as incentives for buying (RED) or donating.  The FILTE(RED) team also hopes to implement a face-detection algorithm to automatically detect placements for the parantheses.  The app itself can be unlocked by sending a Tweet or posting a status to raise awareness.  FILTE(RED) can become more accessible to other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.  (RED) can also partner with a sponsor to 40 cents for each FILTE(RED) picture produced.</p><br>
                <p class="lead"><b>How to use the app:</b><br>First, upload the desired picture from your computer.  The standard picture size is 612x612 pixels, or the size of an Instagram image.  Next, click the button to make yourself (RED) and resize, rotate, and position the parantheses on top of the photo.  You can add as many sets of parantheses as you would like.  Finally, share your creation with the world!  Save the photo, Tweet it, make it your profile picture, and continue to support (RED)!</p><br>
                <p class="lead">We would like to thank Square for hosting Code Camp and providing us with this amazing opportunity.  Thank you to (RED) for inspiring our hackathon, Hotel Zetta for hosting us.  Thank you to Rachel and Vanessa for going above and beyond in every aspect of Code Camp.  Thank you to Derrick and Kat for all of the technical support throughout the hackathon and Vanessa for all of the moral support!  We must also extend a thank you to github, SublimeText, Bootstrap, StackOverflow, the TwitterAPI, Fabric.js, and Photoshop.  And finally, thanks to Ashton Kutcher for calling us hot.</p>
